# NFy Mono Launcher

Proof of concept for an NFy Downloader (Potential template for more installers)

Download the njmonol.exe file (it is self contained using the BumbleBee Utility/Game engine, which enhances self-contained binaries.)

And run it, it'll load the GUI, and you can choose versions to install.

NJMonoLauncher is written in C#.

**Known Bug:** there is an issue when trying to download the MacOS beta, since it is not supported. Please refrain from downloading it
as it will not be able to convert it to a version number (the mac beta did not follow ver rules)
