# NFy Mono Launcher

Proof of concept for an NFy Downloader (Potential template for more installers)

Download the njmonol.exe file (it is self contained using the BumbleBee Utility/Game engine, which enhances self-contained binaries.)

And run it, it'll load the GUI, and you can choose versions to install.

NJMonoLauncher is written in C#.
